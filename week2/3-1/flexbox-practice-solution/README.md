# Flexbox Practice

1. Fork into your account
1. Create a feature branch
1. Clone down to your machine
1. Submit a Pull Request when complete

Apply your understanding of flexbox as you work from the [annoted mock-up](./mockup-annotated.png) to create HTML and CSS.

You'll find assets the designer has provided you with in the `images/` folder.

Make sure to use flexbox for:

 - the navigation menu
 - the list of recent blog posts
 - the list of community members
