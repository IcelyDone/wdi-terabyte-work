# React Counter

## Instructions

- When the component is first mounted, the title should be changed from "Set Me When Mounted!" to "My React Counter"
- Your Counter should be able to increment and decrement from its initial value of 0. The value can go below 0
- Your TitleInput should be able to update the title in the App component each time you type.
- Add a button that lets you add multiple counters. Each counter should have its only independent values, increment and decrement
- Add a button that allows you to increment ALL counters and another that allows you to decrement ALL counters.
